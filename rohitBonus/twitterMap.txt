Please imagine a world with me.

The algorithms TAs have uncovered some information that could save the world! The only trouble is, none of us are social media giants (I know, extremely unrealistic). In this imaginary, ludicrous world, everyone is on twitter and retweets everything they see on twitter. In this world, Twitter only shows you tweets from people you follow, no ads (again, crazy, I know).

We plan on splitting our message amongst k people. We need to find k people such that if they each tweet part of the message, each of the k total messages will spread throughout the entire world. Your job is to find all k influencers that we could potentially split our tweets among.

To make your job easier, we have represented people as integers. Complete associated methods to help us figure out who to contact and how to save the world. Feel free to write other methods, beyond whatâ€™s provided in the skeleton code, as you need them. Please see the public test cases to understand how we will pass in this information to you.

Tips to save the world:

Start early
Ask questions during office hours
Draw Pictures
Write out potential algorithms by hand
Start early
TODO:
Complete the findKPeople() method. This method is called using a twitterMap object, takes in no inputs, and returns the total k influencers in a given map.
Have fun
Examples:
Person A follows Person B indicated by B -> A (the concept here is that the arrow represents the path of the tweet)

Twitter Topology #1
1 -> 2
2 -> 3
4 -> 3
2 -> 4

twitterMapObj.findKPeople() returns [1] // in this case, the total number of influencers is 1
// (represented by [1]) and we need to condense our world-saving information into 1 tweet, we
// do not tell you the total number of influencers (k) ahead of time

Twitter Topology #2
0 -> 1
0 -> 2
1 -> 3
4 -> 1
6 -> 4
4 -> 6
6 -> 0
5 -> 2
5 -> 6
6 -> 5

twitterMapObj.findKPeople() returns [4, 5, 6] // in this case, the total number of influencers is 3
// (represented by [4, 5, 6]) and we need to condense our world-saving information into 3 tweets, we do
// not tell you the total number of influencers (k) ahead of time
