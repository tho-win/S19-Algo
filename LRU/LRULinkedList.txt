In this excerise you will implement a LRU (Least recently used) doublely linked list. In an LRU list the nodes are
ordered by the time in which they were recently accessed. (From Least Recently Used to Most recently used)


             --------------       --------------
            |   key        |     |   key        |
            |   Item       |     |   Item       |
    null<-- |   Previous   |<--- |   Previous   |
            |   Next       |---->|   Next       |--->null
             --------------       --------------
                    ^
                    |
                    |
              Least Recently
                 Accessed

Your doubly linked list will have fixed capacity (n). Any new nodes should be added to the head of the list and if the list is at capacity, the tail node (the one least recently used) should be removed.  When an element is accessed it moved to the head of the list.

Implement the double linked list by completig the associated skeleton code.
